## Architecture

### Preset Curation Mode

- [x] Session-only `editor_mode` under Settings; curation allowlists panel rows and keyboard shortcuts; dirty-entry save/discard; YAML reload on exit to visualizer.

### projectM

- Tie projectM mesh size to `render_mode` (internal warp mesh resolution, separate from Cleave layer FBO downscaling in [cleave/viz/layer_preview_resolution.py](cleave/viz/layer_preview_resolution.py)).

- Review beat sensitivity scaling: [cleave/projectm.py](cleave/projectm.py) `feed_pcm` pre-scales samples by beat sensitivity, which couples that knob to hard-cut detection; native projectM keeps beat sensitivity and hard cut sensitivity independent.

- **Robustness and API coverage:** Done. See [projectm-api-coverage.md](projectm-api-coverage.md). Native playlist load path (no custom `preset_load` callback), switch-failed draining, optional debug logging.
