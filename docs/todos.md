## Beat grid and cue snap

### Sparse song anchors (after the grid is solid)
* Manual "drop song cue" at major transitions for guaranteed pops solves a
  different problem from beat snap (structure vs pulse).
* Prefer automation: auto-suggested anchors (energy / novelty / structure), with
  optional manual drop only to correct or pin a few points.
* Do not make dense hand-cueing the normal path.

## Architecture

### projectM

- Tie projectM mesh size to `render_mode` (internal warp mesh resolution, separate from Cleave layer FBO downscaling in [cleave/viz/layer_preview_resolution.py](cleave/viz/layer_preview_resolution.py)).

- Review beat sensitivity scaling: [cleave/projectm.py](cleave/projectm.py) `feed_pcm` pre-scales samples by beat sensitivity, which couples that knob to hard-cut detection; native projectM keeps beat sensitivity and hard cut sensitivity independent.

- **Robustness and API coverage:** Done. See [projectm-api-coverage.md](projectm-api-coverage.md). Native playlist load path (no custom `preset_load` callback), switch-failed draining, optional debug logging.
